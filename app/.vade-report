  - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
  - Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and styling

### 3. Verification

## Implementation Details

This is an App Router project (Next.js 16.1.6) with the app directory structure. The Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `app/src/app/layout.tsx`, which is the standard location for global components in App Router projects.

The `<Analytics />` component is placed at the end of the `<body>` tag to ensure it doesn't interfere with the main content rendering and follows Vercel's recommended best practices.

## Files Changed
- `app/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `app/pnpm-lock.yaml` - New lockfile for dependency management
- `app/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics component import and usage
