# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` to lock the dependency versions

### 2. Code Changes

**Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after `{children}` for optimal performance
- Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and styling

## Implementation Details

This is a Next.js App Router project (using the `app` directory), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file. The component is placed at the end of the body tag, which is the recommended location according to Vercel's documentation, ensuring:
- Minimal impact on initial page load performance
- Proper tracking of all page views and interactions
- No interference with existing page content

## Verification

All verification steps completed successfully:
1. ✅ Dependencies installed using npm
2. ✅ Build completed successfully (`npm run build`)
3. ✅ Linter passed with no errors (`npm run lint`)
4. ✅ All changes staged with git

The project now has Vercel Web Analytics enabled and will automatically start tracking analytics once deployed to Vercel.
