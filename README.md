# TriTimes

This repo contains code for the TriTimes project.

TriTimes lets athletes see their historical IronMan and IronMan 70.3 results. For an individual result, it presents distributions for each discipline (swim, bike, run) and a combined distribution for their total time. The distributions show how an athlete performed releative to their age group and overall.

TriTimes collects data from <https://www.ironman.com/races/im703-new-york/results>.
