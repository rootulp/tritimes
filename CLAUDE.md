This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TriTimes is a web application that lets athletes view their historical IronMan and IronMan 70.3 triathlon results. For each result, it shows statistical distributions for each discipline (swim, bike, run) and total time, comparing performance against the athlete's age group and overall field.

Data is collected from https://www.ironman.com/races/im703-new-york/results. Inspired by https://www.hyresult.com/.

## Repository Status

This project is in its initial stage with no source code yet — only a README.md exists.
